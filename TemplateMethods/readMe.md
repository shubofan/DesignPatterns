### Template Method pattern

#### Intent
    1. Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to client subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
    
    2. Base class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes implement the placeholders.
